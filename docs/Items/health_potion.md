# Health Potion

Health Potions are common consumables which can be used in or out of combat to restore 25 HP

### Stats

* Healing Amount: 25
* Stack Size `1-3`
* Value: 25

### Use

Health Potions can be used to recover 25 HP in or out of combat. When used in Combat, they consume 1 turn (in single battles) or 1 AP (in multi-battles). Health Potions only restore missing HP, so if you're at full HP than they won't do anything

### Obtaining

Players start with **3** health potions by default, but there are other ways of obtaining, listed below:

* Shops for 50 Coins
* Goblins (30% chance)
* Orcs (20%)
* Treasure Chests
