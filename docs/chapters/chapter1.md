# Chapter 1

## Act 1 - The Village

The journey begins in the village of **stonewood**, a peaceful town not affected by the corruption... Until today.

The corruption infected the goblins from the nearby forest, turning them from petty thieves into monsterous murderers, without warning, the goblins raid the town, destorying everything in sight, You are now forced to make a choice: 

### Path: Fight
You muster what little courage you have and fight the goblins, bound by a decade old commitment to protect this once quaint town. you succeed at taking one down, but many more approach, and you're forced to flee, but before you leave you hear a whisper from a goblin "The Corruption will consume us all"

As you flee, you watch your home get ravaged by the goblins, despite everything, you had failed. You press on, your only hope is reaching The Iron Fist, the once legendary guild that has layed dormient in the shadows, the forest awaits, but what awaits you?

As you wander through

### Path: Flee
You sneak into the shadows, avoiding conflict and escaping the town unsacaved, but you ponder yourself "Did I make the right choice?". You watch the village get raided, you hear the screams of the villagers as they're ripped to shreads by the vicous goblins. Something isn't right

As you sprint through the forest, you lose your sense of direction, but that probably wasn't the best choice, as you run into a Orc, but something looks off-- It's eyes glow an unatural purple, and it's muttering strange noises, you are forced into combat, and knock the Orc out.

## Goblin Camp

You find yourself at the enterance to a heavly guarded goblin camp, you hear the grows and laughs of the goblins, but notice one isn't acting right, it looks like the leader, but it's grumbling and snapping in and out of reality. It's acting without will

You enter the camp, and get jumped by the goblins, forced into combat, you manage to defeat them, but than the strange goblin taps each of his bortheren, corrupting them, causing them to turn into Corrupted Goblins, these vicous beasts swarm you, forcing you to execute quick thinking to survive
