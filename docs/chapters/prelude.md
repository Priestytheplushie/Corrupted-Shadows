# Prelude: The Great War

Fifty years ago, a devestating war which shaped history broke out. two factions, The Iron Fist, and the Crimson Legion fought for control of this once peaceful province, The battle raged across the land, creating a massive influecne still felt today. In the end, the Crimson Legion was defeated, and forced to surrender deep inside a cave... The Iron Fist took over, banishing the Legion and taking control of the land, but in the shadows, something was building...

Though the world had ended, the effects hadn't, many people turned on the Iron Fist, finding their rulings unfair, unjust, and undeserved, but the world had bigger issues, Deep within the very cave in which the Legion fell, a corruption was building... 

Fueld by hatred, driven by vengeance, the corruption spread throught the world, infecting monsters, nature, and people alike. Villages fell, entire echosystems withered away, and vicious monsters rose from the depths. Despite the chaos, the Iron Fist laid dormient, standing silently in the background.

The world would never be the same again...

And now you stand, fifty years later, here to finish what the legion couldn't, Venturing through a scarred world plegued of evil and corruption. You must cleanse the world from the ancient evil which has plegued this world for far too long... but you are all alone, and are there even people left to save?
