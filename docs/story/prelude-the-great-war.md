<summary>Spoiler: Full Prelude</summary>

Fifty years after The Great War, the world was slowly healing from the scars of battle, The Iron Fist had won and the Crimson Legion was banished, but one day.... everything changed&#x20;

A corruption spread from the shadows, infecting the vicious monsters lying in wait, the once peaceful world changed, Monsters became aggressive, people went missing, and rumors spread from village to village, of strange occurrences happening throughout the land

The world went into madness, Villages fell, monsters ruled, and the peace earned from the war was stolen by the monsters. The world found itself plagued by an ancient evil, poisoned by the hatred and vengeance of war

The world would never be the same again...

And now you stand, years later, here to finish what the factions couldn't but, it's been so long... Are there even people left to save?
